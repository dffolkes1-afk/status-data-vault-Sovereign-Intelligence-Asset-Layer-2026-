Status Data Vault is the sovereign intelligence core of the Status Network. It defines what data may exist, how it is aggregated, sealed, and monetized, and what is permanently forbidden. The Vault converts ambient activity into non-extractive intelligence products without storing identities, raw behavior, or surveillance data

The Status Data Vault is the sealed intelligence core of the Status Network.

It converts ambient activity across media, housing, education, and commerce into non-extractive, sovereign data assets that governments, banks, and enterprises can subscribe to without accessing individual identities.

The Vault never stores raw personal data.
It stores aggregated intelligence products generated at the edge and cryptographically sealed before entry.

This repository defines:

What data assets exist

How they are classified

Who may access them

How they are monetized

What is permanently prohibited

People Are Not the Product
Individuals are never sold, profiled, or tracked.

Aggregation at Birth
Data enters the Vault only after anonymization and aggregation.

No Retroactive Exposure
Historical data cannot be re-identified or reprocessed.

Sovereign Containment
Data never leaves its legal jurisdiction unsealed.

Insight, Not Surveillance
Buyers receive intelligence products, not raw feeds.
